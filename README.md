# ZOOPSIGN_TESTCASE
In the ZoopSign project, I was responsible for validating the Contract Execution workflow, which is a critical feature allowing users to finalize digital contracts with legally binding signatures
 I designed over 20 detailed test cases covering positive, negative, boundary, and real-time scenarios. These included checking the transition from draft to executed state, validating the presence of digital signatures, verifying timestamp accuracy, testing email notifications, and ensuring user permission restrictions. I also included edge cases like executing with missing mandatory fields, invalid dates, special characters, and tested responsiveness across devices and browsers.

To ensure reliability, I performed manual test execution using real data and observed system behavior closely, reporting bugs via Jira with proper severity and priority. I also tested contract execution APIs using Postman and collaborated with developers to reproduce, verify, and close defects. This approach helped ensure a smooth and secure contract execution process, eliminating bugs like missing signatures, status mismatch, and unauthorized access. My contribution ensured a more stable and compliant digital signing experience for users.
